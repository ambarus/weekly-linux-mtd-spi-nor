1/ Topics that we want to discuss during the meeting:news:
ta:
- review patches, resend what I authored and left behind

mw:
- to choose patches that want to review and inform ta so that we don't duplicate
effort

py:

2/TODO queue - long term goal
mw:
py:
- Clean up how address width is calculated.

ta:
- FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver under
mtd.
- frequency sync between SPIMEM and SPI controller
- parse manufacturer SFDP backbone -> applies to mchp's sst26 flashes,
     they define a vendor specific sfdp table, where the memory organization
     for the individual block protection is described. Parse that and add
     Individual Block Locking ops.

not allocated:
- dummy.nbytes conversion to dummy.cycles
- SFDP decoder: let's add it in mtd-utils.
    - mw proposed https://github.com/linuxhw/EDID as a reference
    - license for sfdp dumps and parser
    - how about integrating the sdfp parser int mtd-utils - david said it's ok
    - sfdp binaries in https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mtd/sfdp/
    - mw already has some PoC regrading the SFDP decoder. Chose C for better
      integration on embedded systems.
