1/ What have I accomplished last week? Do I need a second opinion on a specific
patch/topic?
mw:

2/ Topics that we want to discuss during the meeting:
ta:
- weekly: get rid of the meeting template and copying last week's file instead?
This way we can copy and paste things from "What we'll try to do this week" to
"What have I accomplished last week?". Plus, fewer files to edit for the
"TODO queue - long term goal".

3/ What we'll try to do this week:
Check the patchwork list and choose something that you're interested in:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=&submitter=&state=&q=spi-nor&archive=&delegate=

ta:
Review:
 - takahiro's spansion patches
 - manuf specific ops:
   https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=237043
 - py's phy calib - at best effort this week
Analyse/write code:
 - FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver under
mtd
- parse manufacturer SFDP backbone -> applies to mchp's sst26 flashes, they
define a vendor specific sfdp table, where the memory organization for the
individual block protection is described. Parse that and add Individual Block
Locking ops.
