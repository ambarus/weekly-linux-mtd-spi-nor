1/ What have I accomplished last week? Do I need a second opinion on a specific
patch/topic?
mw:
 - new SFDP patch version

py:
- Patch for the odd length/address reads or writes in 8D-8D-8D flashes.

ta:

vr:
 - likely take care of the patches for the v5.14 release

2/ Topics that we want to discuss during the meeting:
ta:
- avoid collisions between flash IDs: jep106BA Standard Manufacturerâ€™s
Identification Code:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/patch/SN6PR06MB5342C82F372F37FB8E21B327A57A9@SN6PR06MB5342.namprd06.prod.outlook.com/
SFDP differentiator or new compatible, SPI NOR opcodes?.

mw:
 - review PHY calib patches
   -  NXP FAE at least responded that you have to do only once on the
      LS1028A, but at the same time they didn't repsond to the question how
      it behhaves when the temperature drifts
 - SFDP database: generate hash/crc for flashes SFDP tables and use the sha
  as differentiator. Do we want to keep a DB?

3/ What we'll try to do this week:
Check the patchwork list and choose something that you're interested in:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=&submitter=&state=&q=spi-nor&archive=&delegate=

py:
 - No pending patches to review.

ta:
  Review:
   - takahiro's spansion patches
   - manuf specific ops:
     https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=237043
   - py's phy calib
  Analyse/write code:
   - FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver
     under mtd
   - parse manufacturer SFDP backbone -> applies to mchp's sst26 flashes,
     they define a vendor specific sfdp table, where the memory organization
     for the individual block protection is described. Parse that and add
     Individual Block Locking ops.

vr:

mw:
 - flash names list
 - phy calib series

4/TODO queue - long term goal
mw:
a/ different flash names for same JEDEC vendor ID

py:
a/ Clean up how address width is calculated.

ta:
a/ FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver under
mtd.
b/ SFDP init first, then flash_info static init if still needed
c/ frequency sync between SPIMEM and SPI controller
d/ SPI NOR documentation

vr:
a/ dummy.nbytes conversion to dummy.cycles
