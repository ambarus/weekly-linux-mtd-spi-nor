1/ What have I accomplished last week? Do I need a second opinion on a specific
patch/topic?
mw:
- new SFDP patch version, using SFDP cache instead of reading on-demand
- worked on NVMEM support for MTD OTP (fact/user_prot). use-case is to have
  a network card get its MAC address from the SPI NOR OTP region.
  Decided to add it to the MTD layer, so it will be also available to any
  flashes which supports OTP, not just SPI NOR.
- very basic SFDP database https://github.com/mwalle/spi-nor-sfdp
  (private repo for now)

py:
- Reviewed https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=233628.
- Not much progress on the PHY calibration front.

ta:
- not so much progress. Looked a bit over OTP, SWP.

3/ What we'll try to do this week:
Check the patchwork list and choose something that you're interested in:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=&submitter=&state=&q=spi-nor&archive=&delegate=

mw:

py:
- Review https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=234846.
  Should address the minor comments I had on the previous version.

ta:
- conclude OTP support
- FRAMs, MRAMs, NORs, EEPROMs overall architecture
- read over the email explaining the need for PHY calibration.

vr:

4/ Meeting notes/minutes
- (ta) revert Macronix patch which added new flash but reused the same id, also
  added SECT_4K, but this is also true for the old flash, so there will be
  a second patch to add SECT_4K to the old one, too.
- (ta) review OTP and spansion series
- (py) review SFDP series

5/TODO queue
mw:
a/ different flash names for same JEDEC vendor ID

py:

ta:
- FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver
  under mtd.
- SFDP init first, then flash_info static init if still needed
- frequency sync between SPIMEM and SPI controller
