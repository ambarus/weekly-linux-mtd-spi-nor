py:

- Continue polishing the PHY calibration series. Maybe try to find out a way to
  use nvmem cells with commandline partitions.
- Review https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=233628
  I reviewed a similar series by Takahiro for U-Boot so it should hopefully have
  all my comments already fixed.
