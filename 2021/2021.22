1/ What have I accomplished last week? Do I need a second opinion on a specific
patch/topic?
mw:
 - SFDP patch series should be the final version. -ok

py:
 - PHY calib patches - need second opinnion, ideas welcommed

ta:

vr:
 - likely take care of the patches for the v5.14 release

2/ Topics that we want to discuss during the meeting:
ta:

mw:
 - review PHY calib patches
   -  NXP FAE at least responded that you have to do only once on the
      LS1028A, but at the same time they didn't repsond to the question how
      it behhaves when the temperature drifts
      - NXP says it only needs to be done once.

 - SFDP database: generate hash/crc for flashes SFDP tables and use the sha
  as differentiator. Do we want to keep a DB?
  - Might want to look into reading SFDP first.
  - If the flash does not support the command does it ignore it?
  - ta - action item!: to decide the read SFDP first idea
  - tight related with the continuation codes and shared flash ID problem

py: dynamically discover a flash even if there's no flash ID in the flash ID
table - what's the use case? no strong opinions for now.


3/ What we'll try to do this week:
Check the patchwork list and choose something that you're interested in:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=&submitter=&state=&q=spi-nor&archive=&delegate=

py:
- Repost odd length/address series with mw's comments.
- Repost PHY series.

ta:
- Talk with vr and see who needs to collect patches.
  Review:
   - takahiro's spansion patches
   - manuf specific ops:
     https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=237043
   - py's phy calib
  Analyse/write code:
   - FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver
     under mtd
   - parse manufacturer SFDP backbone -> applies to mchp's sst26 flashes,
     they define a vendor specific sfdp table, where the memory organization
     for the individual block protection is described. Parse that and add
     Individual Block Locking ops.

vr:

mw:
 - flash names list

4/TODO queue - long term goal
mw:
a/ different flash names for same JEDEC vendor ID

py:
a/ Clean up how address width is calculated.

ta:
a/ FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver under
mtd.
b/ SFDP init first, then flash_info static init if still needed
c/ frequency sync between SPIMEM and SPI controller
d/ SPI NOR documentation

vr:
a/ dummy.nbytes conversion to dummy.cycles
