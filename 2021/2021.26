1/ What have I accomplished last week? Do I need a second opinion on a specific
patch/topic?
mw:

py:

ta:

vr:
 - Has taken care of the patches for the v5.14 release

2/ Topics that we want to discuss during the meeting:
ta:
- Differentiate flashes at runtime.
  - On Macronix flash, one has SFDP other doesn't. Macronix recommends agaist it but should be no risk.
  - Try to differentiate between SFDP data if flashes both have SFDP.
  - If two manuf have similar flashes with no continuation codes, have a separate
    driver that will mark the flashes for collision and differentiate at runtime.
  - Last resort will be a compatible in DT.

- When introducing a new flash add a flag for SFDP capable so we don't need a long list of flags for the flash.
  - If SFDP is broken, use skip SFDP flag. Makes it clear what gets initialized how.

mw:
 - review PHY calib patches
   -  NXP FAE at least responded that you have to do only once on the
      LS1028A, but at the same time they didn't repsond to the question how
      it behhaves when the temperature drifts
      - NXP says it only needs to be done once.

 - SFDP database: generate hash/crc for flashes SFDP tables and use the sha
  as differentiator. Do we want to keep a DB?
  - Might want to look into reading SFDP first.
  - If the flash does not support the command does it ignore it?
  - ta - action item!: to decide the read SFDP first idea
  - tight related with the continuation codes and shared flash ID problem

py: dynamically discover a flash even if there's no flash ID in the flash ID
table - what's the use case? no strong opinions for now.

vr:
- Flashes that boot in 8D-8D-8D mode are another problem. Might be able to use SFDP to detect flash mode.
- Read ID is the basic requirement to call a flash "jedec,spi-nor". If you don't have that then can't be JEDEC compatible.

3/ What we'll try to do this week:
Check the patchwork list and choose something that you're interested in:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=&submitter=&state=&q=spi-nor&archive=&delegate=

py:
- Repost PHY series.

ta:
  Review:
   - takahiro's spansion patches
   - manuf specific ops:
     https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-mtd/list/?series=237043
   - py's phy calib
  Analyse/write code:
   - FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver
     under mtd
   - parse manufacturer SFDP backbone -> applies to mchp's sst26 flashes,
     they define a vendor specific sfdp table, where the memory organization
     for the individual block protection is described. Parse that and add
     Individual Block Locking ops.
- Try to send ID collision patches.
- Review 8D-8D-8D padding series.

vr:

mw:
 - flash names list

4/TODO queue - long term goal
mw:
a/ different flash names for same JEDEC vendor ID

py:
a/ Clean up how address width is calculated.

ta:
a/ FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver under
mtd.
b/ SFDP init first, then flash_info static init if still needed
c/ frequency sync between SPIMEM and SPI controller
d/ SPI NOR documentation

vr:
a/ dummy.nbytes conversion to dummy.cycles
