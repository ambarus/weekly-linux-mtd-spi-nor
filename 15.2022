Atendees: Michael, Tudor

1/ Topics that we want to discuss during the meeting:
news:
- py to handle 5.19 release, ta to assist

ta:
- to resend patches so that pratyush can apply them early in the rc
- to review takahiro's patches
- to jump in the phy calib discussion

- will queue patches to spi-nor/next during merge window, then rebase on top
of v5.18-rc1
- need review on patches: template ops, rdid refactor, manufacturers octal dtr
rework, octal dtr swab16, macronix flash
- to rework collision ID thingy based on mw's idea.
- SFDP database repo - license concerns. ta to ask in mchp.
	- mw proposed https://github.com/linuxhw/EDID as a reference
- SFDP decoder: let's add it in mtd-utils.
- TODO
	- resend SPI NOR documentation, Collision ID patches, erase fixes

mw:
- license for sfdp dumps and parser
- ta: how about integrating the sdfp parser int mtd-utils - david said it's ok
- sfdp binaries in https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mtd/sfdp/
- already has some PoC regrading the SFDP decoder. Chose C for better integration
  on embedded systems.
- review PHY calib patches (with Pratyush)
   -  NXP FAE at least responded that you have to do only once on the
      LS1028A, but at the same time they didn't repsond to the question how
      it behhaves when the temperature drifts
      - NXP says it only needs to be done once.

py:
- kernel email address, repo write rights and patchwork access.
- if time permits to test micron and spansion with michael's and ta's octal dtr
patches
- to review few patches
- u-boot: SPI NOR reset sequence
- u-boot: re-sync with linux kernel's SPI NOR's.
- dynamically discover a flash even if there's no flash ID in the flash ID
table - what's the use case? no strong opinions for now.

vr:
- Flashes that boot in 8D-8D-8D mode are another problem. Might be able to use SFDP to detect flash mode.
- Read ID is the basic requirement to call a flash "jedec,spi-nor". If you don't have that then can't be JEDEC compatible.
	- ta: Is this specified in JESD216?

2/TODO queue - long term goal
mw:
py:
a/ Clean up how address width is calculated.

ta:
a/ FRAMs, MRAMs, SPI NORs, EEPROMs. Check if we can have a single driver under
mtd.
b/ SFDP init first, then flash_info static init if still needed
c/ frequency sync between SPIMEM and SPI controller
d/ parse manufacturer SFDP backbone -> applies to mchp's sst26 flashes,
     they define a vendor specific sfdp table, where the memory organization
     for the individual block protection is described. Parse that and add
     Individual Block Locking ops.
vr:
a/ dummy.nbytes conversion to dummy.cycles
